# Pod Thing: The Spotify controller resembles iPod.

This project is inspired by the [GuyDupont's Pi Zero W powered iPod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxdhG1OhVng&ab_channel=GuyDupont) and the Car Thing from Spotify.

# Hardware design
Circuit
- Using the memory display module (cut the ears)
- Using the navigation encoder module
- Using the feather
- Pcb is only used for connecting the modules
    - not many circuits on the PCB except the switch

Case
- use front and back panels
- navigation PCB is fixed to the front panel by zip tie through the 4 holes
    - all circuits are suspended in the enclosure by this connection
- two panels are temporarily put together with 4 magnets
    - in order to reach the PCB during the development
- two panels are permanently put together by zip tie on the sides
